## Week 01
As a group we create a screenflow using Figma that represents a general system for the use of a gym. Personally, I had to participate together with two partners in the realization of the landing page of the system, with a format not only for a desktop computer, but also for a tablet and a cell phone.

## Week 02
This week the landing page for week 1 was structured in HTML, this time individually. Day by day progress was stored in Git and pushed to GitHub.

## Week 03
This week the landing page was organized with the use of CSS and based on the HTML of the previous week, which necessarily had to be modified to better suit the task
